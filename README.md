Hey folks 👋

This repository features a from-scratch clone of another landing page, recreated with obsessive attention to detail and zero shortcuts.

⏱️ Time Invested: 10+ hours (and a few sleepless nights)

## Tech Stack

HTML5 – fully semantic markup for structure, clarity, and accessibility

CSS3 – handcrafted styles with a component-first mindset

Pure HTML & CSS – no frameworks, no libraries, no safety net

---

## What I Focused On

Pixel-level precision while chasing visual perfection

Replicating layouts, spacing, and typography as accurately as possible

Clean, meaningful class names for long-term readability

Writing maintainable CSS despite growing file size

---

## Challenges Faced

😵 Sleepless nights – perfection doesn’t respect clocks
🎯 Chasing precision – tiny inconsistencies were not allowed to survive
📐 Manual layout control – every margin, flex, and alignment handled by hand
🧵 Large CSS files – keeping styles organized without a framework took discipline

Why Pure HTML & CSS?

Because understanding the fundamentals deeply beats leaning on abstractions too early.
This project was about control, patience, and sharpening the basics.
